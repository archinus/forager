forager
=======

Forager is an IRC utility bot that gathers information. It has the ability track links, trending terms, and channel popularity. I built this bot on top of the Pirc API. This is the very first bot i've programmed, and my first real useful project. I had two reasons for making this bot, the first being that i wanted to improve my programming skills, and the second being that i wanted to be able to see the links i missed in chat when i wasn't watching IRC.
